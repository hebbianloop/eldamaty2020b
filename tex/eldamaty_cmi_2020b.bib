%%% Bibliographic Database for LaTeX (BibTeX)
%%
%%  What is this? -- A bibliographic database file that allows for automatic reference generation in any specified style by pulling from metadata organized as key : value pairs
%%
%% Why should I care? -- This makes assembling references incredibly easy
%%
%% How do I use this? -- Add an entry to the bibliography as a book, collection, proceeding, database, manual, article etc. using the example templates included below. 
%% It is actually MUCH easier to use google scholar to automatically generate this object for you --> just find your reference in google scholar, click on the quotation mark that gives you the citation and then click on the "BibTeX" link to automatically generate the entry. You can copy paste that into this file.
%%
%% How do I reference in line? -- Use the \cite command to reference an entry in the database. Overleaf will autocomplete for you. Each reference entry is indexed by the very first line in the entry. For example the entry below:
%%
@book{book,
  author    = {Author Name}, 
  title     = {The title of the work},
  publisher = {The name of the publisher},
  address   = {The city},
  year      = 1993,
}
%% would be referenced by --> \cite{book} 
%  --> Very easy, see .tex file for example
%%
%% Lastly: To actually generate the references you need to make sure to add a \bibliography{file} at the end of your latex document. Do not include the file extension (.bib). File is the name of the bibliography (i.e., the file you are reading now). Please make sure to also include a \bibliographystyle{style} command to load the style. A default is "plain", you can try "apacite" or downloading your favorite journal and using their .bst file.
